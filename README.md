# Data-structures

# Data Structures
- Fundamental ways of organizing and storing data.
- Examples include lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.

# Defining Functions
- Functions are blocks of reusable code.
- Defined using the `def` keyword.
- Can have parameters and return values.

# Using Lists as Stacks and Queues
- Lists can be used as stacks (Last In, First Out) or queues (First In, First Out).
- Methods like `append()` and `pop()` for stack behavior.
- `pop(0)` for queue behavior.

# List Comprehensions
- Concise way to create lists.
- Written in a single line.
- Example: `[x**2 for x in range(10)]`

# Nested List Comprehensions
- Using list comprehensions within list comprehensions.
- Example: `[[x*y for y in range(5)] for x in range(5)]`

# The `del` Statement / Tuples and Sequences
- `del` removes an item from a list by index.
- Tuples are immutable sequences.

# Sets
- Unordered collections of unique elements.
- Created using `{}` or `set()`.

# Looping Techniques
- Iterating over a sequence using loops.
- `for` and `while` loops.

# Comparing Sequences and Other Types
- Comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `==`, etc.) work on sequences.
- Different types have different comparison rules.

## How to create a list?
- Square brackets `[]` define a list.
- Example: `my_list = [1, 2, 3]`

## Access List Elements
- Elements accessed by index.
- Indexing starts at 0.

## Negative Indexing
- Allows accessing elements from the end.
- Example: `my_list[-1]` accesses the last element.

## How to slice lists in Python?
- Slicing creates a new list from a subset of elements.
- Example: `my_list[1:4]` returns elements 1 to 3.

## Add/Change List Elements
- Use `append()` to add at the end.
- Assign to an index to change an element.

## Delete/Remove List Elements
- `del` statement or `remove()` method.

## Python List Methods
- Methods like `sort()`, `reverse()`, etc.

## List Comprehension: Elegant way to create Lists
- Concise way to create lists in a single line.
- Example: `[x*2 for x in range(5)]`

## Other List Operations in Python
- Operations like finding length (`len()`), maximum (`max()`), minimum (`min()`), etc.

## Iterating Through a List
- Use `for` loop to iterate over elements.

# Errors
- Mistakes in code execution.
- Syntax errors and logical errors.

# Exceptions
- Events that occur during program execution.

# Handling Exceptions
- `try` and `except` blocks handle exceptions.
- Prevents program crashes.

# Raising an Exception
- `raise` statement triggers an exception.

# The `AssertionError` Exception
- Raised when an `assert` statement fails.

# The try and except Block
- Used for handling exceptions.
- Code in the `try` block is executed.

# User-Defined Exceptions
- Custom exceptions defined by the programmer.

# Defining Clean-up Actions
- `finally` block ensures code runs, whether an exception occurs or not.

# Classes
- Blueprint for creating objects.
- Encapsulates data and behavior.

# Names and Objects
- Objects are instances of classes.
- Variables are names bound to objects.

# Python Scopes and Namespaces
- Scope defines where a variable can be accessed.
- Namespace is a container for variables.

# Class Definition Syntax
- `class` keyword followed by class name and colon.

# Class Objects
- Instances of a class.

# Instance Objects
- Objects created from a class.

# Method Objects
- Functions defined within a class.

# Class and Instance Variables
- Variables shared among all instances or specific to an instance.

# Random Remarks
- Miscellaneous observations or comments about classes and objects.
